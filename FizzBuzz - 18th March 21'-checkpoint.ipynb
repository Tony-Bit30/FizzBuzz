    "#You're about to do an assignment called \"Fizz Buzz\", which is one of the classic programming challenges. It is a favorite for interviewers, and a shocking number of job-applicants can't get it right. But you won't be one of those people. Here are the rules for the assignment (as specified by Imran Gory):\n",
    "\n",
    "#Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "#But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#The one hint you'll likely need is: \n",
    "\n",
    "#There is a Python operator called \"modulo\", represented by the percentage sign (%) that gives you the remainder left over after division. So for example:\n",
    "\n",
    " #6 % 3\n",
    "\n",
    "#Equals zero. Because after dividing 6 by 3, there is zero leftover. Whereas:\n",
    "\n",
    "#6 % 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#Equals 2. Because after dividing 6 by 4, there are 2 left over from the six.\n",
    "\n",
    "#If that was confusing, don't worry. It will make more sense as you use it. The point is: the modulo operator is useful for finding out if X is a multiple of Y. If it is, then X % Y will yield zero. Knowing this should help you complete this assignment without any issue.\n",
